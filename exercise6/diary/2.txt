An old woman had a cat.The cat was very old; she could not run quickly,and she could not bite,because she was so old.
One day the old cat saw a mouse; she jumped and caught the mouse.But she could not bite it; so the mouse got out of her mouth and ran away,because the cat could not bite it.
Then the old woman became very angry because the cat had not killed the mouse.She began to hit the cat.The cat said,"Do not hit your old servant.I have worked for you
for many years,and I would work for you still,but I am too old.Do not be unkind to the old,but remember what good work the old did when they were young hard-work."
